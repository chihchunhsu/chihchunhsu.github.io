							<p>I had extensive teaching and outreach experience since my graduate studies.
							During my Ph.D. at UC San Diego, I taught various classes with a total of 15 quarters of teaching experience, including the
								<ul>
									<li>Undergraudate stellar astrophysics (PHYS5, PHYS 160),</li>
									<li>Undergraduate stellar classical mechanics (PHYS 1A), </li>
									<li>Undergraduate physics lab in classical mechanics (PHYS 2BL), and </li>
									<li>Undergraduate physics lecture/lab in modern physics (PHYS 2D/2DL).</li>
								</ul>

								While these teaching has been a strong time commitment other than my research during my Ph.D., I feel accomplished and rewarded when students have learned during these classes because good teachers and mentors have been part of the reason for my academic and research journey. <br>
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								From 2021 to 2022, I mentored three undergraduate students to curate a sample of ultracool dwarf wide binaries using <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649A...1G/abstract">Gaia eDR3</a> curated by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.2269E/abstract">El-Badry</a>. The result has been submitted to AAS Research Notes. <br>

								In 2019, I was awarded the Carol and George Lattimer Award for Graduate Excellence, for graduate students in the Divisions of Physical Sciences who seek interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving and have a strong commitment to education, mentorship, and service. <br>
							</p>
							<hr />
							<p>
								I also participated in various outreach activities, including the
								<ul>
									<li>2019 Institute for Scientist & Engineer Educations (ISEE) Professional Development Program (PDP) that provided a one-day Python workshop for transferred students from community college to UCLA,</li>
									<li>2017 IOA Science Innovation Camp Physics Outreach designed for Latin American high-school students,</li>
									<li>2019 The Barrio Logan Science & Art Expo aimed at promoting physical education and outreach toward Mexican families, and </li>
									<li>Three consecutive years (2019-2021) of Python Workshop for Physics Undergraduate Students to help bridge the programming skills for transferred students from community college to UCSD.</li>
								</ul>
								Recently, I was invited to talk about my recent discovery of the <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/01/ultracool-dwarf-binary-stars-break-records/">shortest-period ultracool dwarf binary</a> at <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/chicago">Astronomy of Tap Chicago</a> in February 2023.
