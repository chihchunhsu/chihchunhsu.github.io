									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<br><img src="images/photo2.jpg" alt="Image" height="400" width="300" />
									<p>I’m a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/">CIERA</a>, studying low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. I am working with <a href="https://jasonwang.space//">Jason Wang</a>. My thesis advisor is <a href="https://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/faculty:Aburgasser">Adam Burgasser</a>.
									<br><br>Here is my complete <a href="pdf/cv_chsu.pdf">CV (updated 2023 January 5)</a>. </p>

								<p>I study ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) and exoplanets using, using both medium- and high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. 
								UCDs (low-mass stars and brown dwarfs) are ubiquitous and long-lived, longer than the age of our universe, which are excellent tracers for our Milky Way's formation history and evolution. I study their motions in space and rotation as a population to understand their formation and evolution, and identify UCD binaries using the RV method.
								<!--Due to their intrinsic faintness and dominant flux peak in near-infrared waveband, the majority of these objects found to date are in our immediate solar neighborhood, using primarily near-infrared imaging surveys such as Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).-->
								</p>
								<!--My thesis work is mainly on measuring precise radial (RV) and rotational velocity (vsini) of UCDs, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling technique, to model high-resolution spectroscopic data including the Keck/NIRSPEC (R~25,000-35,000) and SDSS/APOGEE (R~22,500) spectrometers, for a sample of size of ~1,000, using both the archival and newly observed data. 
								Studying these two parameters enables us to study their population and individual kinematics, binaries, and rotations. 
								The ultimate science goal is to understand their formation history and evolution through population kinematics, and therefore to examine and constrain the fundamental parameters at lowest-mass end including mass function, star formation history, and brown dwarf evolutionary models.
								<p>-->
								<p>
								I am also studying exoplanets using the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JATIS...7c5006D/abstract">Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)</a>, which is designed to obtain diffraction limited, high-resolution near-infrared spectra for directly-imaged gas-giant exoplanets using adaptive optics. I am studying their surface temperature and gravity, spins, and abundances, hoping to understand them at the population level.

								<p> Originally from Taiwan, I got my B.S. in Physics at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2014 and was a former member of NTHU's astronomy club.
								I moved to San Diego as a Physics graduate student at UC San Diego in 2016. I am a postdoctoral researcher at CIERA of Northwestern University since 2022 September.
								When I am free, I like to classical, US-/Mando-/J-pop, R&B, karaoke, coffee, and tennis. I was a big fan of NBA. </p>

								<p><b>Radial and Rotational Velocities of Ultracool Dwarfs Using Keck/NIRSPEC and SDSS/APOGEE High-Resolution Spectrometer</b>
								<br>Precise RV time series are essential for identifying binaries and measuring their orbital parameters and masses, combining relative and absolute astrometry measurements. For example, the figure on the left shows a spectrum and the best-fit model of a likely brown dwarf triple system using the forward-modeling technique.</p> 
								<!--One of my research projects includes modeling all archival and obtained NIRSPEC UCD spectra using such techique (number of sources > 450). I have modeled 37 nearby (<20 pc) T dwarfs and achieved median precisions of 0.5 km/s, 0.9 km/s for RV and v<i>sin</i> i, respectively. The project expands the understanding of the T dwarfs in the solar neighborhood by >4 times larger compared to the previous local T dwarf 6D kinematics studies.</p>-->

								<p><b>A possible resolution of local L dwarf kinematics mystery, and identification of a kinematics potential stellar and substellar boundary</b>
								<br>
								In the first <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..257...45H/abstract">paper</a> of my thesis, I presented a resolution to the mystery by examining 172 nearby ultracool dwarfs, using the 10-meter Keck II telescope's high-resolution near-infrared spectrometer NIRSPEC.
								I reported the largest precise radial and rotational velocities compilations of local 37 T dwarfs within 20 pc, four times larger than the most recent T dwarf measurements. 
								<!--Combining other 5-dimensional measurements with other telescopes and instruments, they measured the local T dwarf kinematic age of 3.5 ± 0.3 Gyr. A compilation of precise 6-D kinematics of the local late-M and L dwarfs gives ages of 4.1 ± 0.3 Gyr and for late-M dwarfs, and 4.2 ± 0.3 Gyr and for thin disk L dwarfs. 
								Thin disk kinematic populations are younger Galactic thin disk members, while thick disk populations are older thick disk members in our Milky Way. -->
								<br>
								I found that local L dwarfs have a relatively higher fraction of thick disk kinematic sources (relatively old populations), which provides a resolution to the local L dwarf kinematic mystery previously reported in the literature.
								<br>
								I also presented the kinematic evidence of the lowest end of stellar Main Sequence around L4-L6 subtypes. L dwarfs are a mixture of stars and brown dwarfs, but there exists a lowest mass end for stars that can sustain hydrogen fusion, and therefore lowest surface temperatures and latest spectral subtypes. 
								<!--I identified that the L dwarf velocity dispersion has a sudden drop later than the L6 subtype, which implies that later than L6 subtype, the population is all brown dwarfs. 
								There are also other measurements on the stellar and substellar boundaries in the literature, using the radius or dynamical mass measurements. All of the methods have small sample sizes for only a few dozens, so a larger sample is needed to refine our understanding of stellar and substellar boundaries and therefore motivates future studies.-->

								<p><b> The first two T dwarf binaries using the RV method</b>
								<br>
								In the same <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..257...45H/abstract">paper</a>, I reported the confirmation of the first two T dwarf binary systems, T0+T4.5 2MASS J11061197+2754225 and the L7+T3.5 2MASS J21265916+7617440 (left figure), using radial velocities from decade-long high-resolution spectroscopic observations.
								These are the first systems of T dwarf RV binaries, which could be benchmark systems for dynamical mass measurements.

								Interested readers can check out my <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4567512">poster</a> presented at the Cool Stars 20.5 virtual conference.

								</p><b> SMART: (Spectral Modeling Analysis and RV Tool)</b>
								<br>
								Under the guidance of Dr. Adam Burgasser and Dr. Christopher Theissen, I also developed a modified data reduction pipeline from the <a href="https://github.com/chihchunhsu/NIRSPEC-Data-Reduction-Pipeline">NIRSPEC Data Reduction Pipeline (NSDRP)</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/chihchunhsu/smart">forward-modeling routine code</a>, to extract RV, vsini, effective temperatures and surface gravities. 
								The forward-modeling tool has been used in multiple peer-reviewed publications, including <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..207W/abstract">Wilcomb et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.5453S/abstract">Sahlmann et al. (2021)</a>.
